    <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
    <p>To get started with this project, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository to your local machine:</li>
        <code>git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-prediction.git</code>
        <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>
        <code>cd stock-prediction</code>
        <li>Install the required dependencies:</li>
        <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
    <p>Once you've installed the project, you can start using it for stock prediction:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Run the data collection script to fetch historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.</li>
        <li>Train the prediction model using Facebook Prophet.</li>
        <li>Make predictions for future stock prices.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The data collection module retrieves historical stock prices from Yahoo Finance using its API. You can specify the ticker symbol and time frame for which you want to collect data. The collected data is then processed and prepared for model training.</p>

    <h2 id="model-training">Model Training</h2>
    <p>This project utilizes Facebook Prophet, a forecasting tool built by Facebook, for time series prediction. Prophet is designed to handle the typical challenges of forecasting such as seasonality, outliers, and missing data. You can train the Prophet model using the historical stock data collected from Yahoo Finance.</p>

    <h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>
    <p>To evaluate the performance of the trained Prophet model, you can use various metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). These metrics help assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data and makes accurate predictions.</p>

    <h2 id="contributing">Contributing</h2>
    <p>Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you want to fix bugs, add new features, or improve documentation, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the project's README file.</p>
